I've been reading the book again (havent gotten into the clean architecture section yet) but realised I've been doing it all 'wrong'. I mixed up
different architectures. So I re-implemented it. One thing that bothers me is that the Adapter layer now depends on both Infra and Application,
which technically would be wrong, but since it's the adapter layer it's not? I'm not sure. Will see soon I suppose.
