# Clean Architecture By Uncle Bob Case Studies

[Open in an online VSCode environment](https://github1s.com/donnyroufs/Clean-Architecture-in-TypeScript-Case-Studies/blob/master/clean-architecture-01/src/bootstrap.ts)

In this repository you will see me struggle to learn his architecture. My knowledge comes from his book :)

Every project will get it's own set of notes, that way you and I can go back in time and figure out what I might have done wrong and why. At a given time
I will add my conclusion in this README. Please feel free to let me know what I might have done wrong!
