the web layer has its own set of dtos which are mostly know as contracts. If it were to render an actual U.I
then you would refer to it as a "View Model". If the deliviery mechanism is a webpage then we do not really need to
make our "contracts" because it's more of an API thing. Instead we can use the presenters!
