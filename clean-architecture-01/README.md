# Clean Architecture 01 (ARCHIVED!)

This is my first "real" attempt on following the concepts of Clean Architecture. I won't touch this specific project anymore because I would like to believe
that I got an okay grasp on things.

## Next Project will most likely focus on:

- Proper Naming & Folder Structure
- Removing presenters
- Using the Result Pattern
- Value Objects
- Clearly understanding the difference between Enterprise wide and Application wide business rules
