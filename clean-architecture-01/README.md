# Clean Architecture 01

This is going to be my first attempt on the Clean Architecture, where I will try to over-engineer most of the things that I know about
and feel 'comfortable' with. When I feel like I have invested enough I will start a new Project with more focus towards a given concept.

## Use-cases

- Create a User with a firstName and lastName
- Get a User with a firstName, lastName and fullName.
